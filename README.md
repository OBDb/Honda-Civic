## Generations

The Honda Civic has gone through eleven main generations, each bringing significant changes and improvements:

- **First Generation (1972-1979)**: The original Civic was introduced as a subcompact car with a 1.2L engine, front-wheel drive, and a focus on fuel efficiency during the oil crisis. Available in hatchback, sedan, and wagon body styles.

- **Second Generation (1979-1983)**: Slightly larger than its predecessor, the second-generation Civic featured more angular styling and introduced the high-performance Civic S model. Engine options expanded to include a 1.5L CVCC engine.

- **Third Generation (1983-1987)**: Introduced a more sophisticated suspension design and the popular CRX variant. This generation saw the introduction of fuel injection on some models and improved aerodynamics.

- **Fourth Generation (1987-1991)**: Known for its sleek, low-slung design with distinctive pop-up headlights on some models. Honda introduced the VTEC engine technology during this generation with the Civic SiR in Japan.

- **Fifth Generation (1991-1995)**: Redesigned with a more rounded, aerodynamic shape. The fifth generation introduced the popular Civic VTi and SiR models with VTEC engines, establishing the Civic's reputation in the sport compact segment.

- **Sixth Generation (1995-2000)**: Featured a more conservative design but continued to improve technically. This generation saw the introduction of the Civic Type R in Japan and a range of improved VTEC engines across the lineup.

- **Seventh Generation (2000-2005)**: Adopted a more upscale approach with improved interior quality and introduced the first Civic Hybrid. This generation moved away from the sportier image of previous models toward a more mature, comfortable design.

- **Eighth Generation (2005-2011)**: Featured a radical redesign with a split-level instrument panel and a more spaceship-like interior design. Performance versions included the Civic Si and the European Civic Type R. Hybrid technology was significantly improved.

- **Ninth Generation (2011-2015)**: Represented an evolutionary design change, focusing on improved fuel efficiency and technology integration. This generation saw enhanced safety features and continued refinement of the Civic Hybrid system.

- **Tenth Generation (2015-2021)**: Marked a significant departure in design with a sportier, more aggressive styling. This generation introduced the turbocharged engines to the Civic lineup, including the powerful Civic Type R globally. Technology and safety features were substantially upgraded.

- **Eleventh Generation (2021-present)**: The current generation features a cleaner, more mature design aesthetic while maintaining sporty characteristics. It offers more technology, improved safety systems, and refined powertrains including both naturally aspirated and turbocharged options. The Civic Type R continues as the performance flagship of the lineup.
